My name is Josh Merfeld and I am an Assistant Professor at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management. I am a development economist interested in poverty, labor, and agriculture. I will begin updating this page as I pivot more towards big data and machine learning, especially as they relate to poverty. 

You can find out more about me on my website: https://sites.google.com/site/joshmerfeld
